# BellaBeat Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **BellaBeat Capstone**, analyzing smart device usage data to provide **actionable insights for BellaBeat**, a health-focused company that manufactures smart wearables for women. The goal is to use **data analytics** to uncover trends in **activity levels, sleep patterns, and calorie expenditure**.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Understand how **users engage with smart devices**.
- Identify **patterns in physical activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure**.
- Compare user behavior trends with industry benchmarks.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to enhance BellaBeat's products and marketing.

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** (Public dataset from Kaggle)
- **User Activity Data** (Steps, Active Minutes, Distance, Sedentary Time)
- **Sleep Data** (Total Sleep Time, Efficiency)
- **Calorie Expenditure Data** (Daily and Activity-Specific Calorie Burn)

## 🔧 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicate or missing values.
   - Standardized variable names and formats.
   - Converted timestamps to proper datetime format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed **trends in physical activity, calorie burn, and sleep behavior**.
   - Visualized data with **histograms, scatter plots, and time-series graphs**.
   - Compared different **activity levels across user segments**.
3. **Statistical Analysis & Insights**
   - Correlation analysis between **steps taken and calories burned**.
   - Examined **sleep patterns and their impact on activity levels**.
   - Identified **peak activity hours** for users.
4. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Generated insights using **ggplot2 in R**.
   - Created summary tables for **user engagement patterns**.
   - Provided business recommendations for **BellaBeat’s product strategy**.

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Users with consistent sleep schedules tend to have higher activity levels.**
- **Calorie expenditure is highest during peak activity hours (morning & evening).**
- **A significant number of users are sedentary for long hours, highlighting a potential area for intervention.**
- **Users who track their sleep tend to be more engaged with fitness tracking overall.**

## 📢 Recommendations
✔ **Encourage users to set personalized fitness goals** via the BellaBeat app.
✔ **Develop a reminder feature** to reduce sedentary time and encourage movement.
✔ **Enhance sleep tracking features** to promote better sleep habits.
✔ **Create targeted marketing campaigns** based on user activity trends.
